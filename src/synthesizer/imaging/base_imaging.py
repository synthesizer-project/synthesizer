"""A base class to encompass common functionality for all imaging classes.

It mostly handles the attributes and operations related to the image's/spectral

    A base class to encompass common functionality for all imaging classes.

    This base classes handles the common geometry operations and related
    information. Of particular importance is the abstraction of
    angular vs cartesian unit systems.

    Attributes:
        cart_resolution (unyt_quantity): The spatial resolution of the image
            in Cartesian coordinates. If the image is in angular coordinates,
            this is None.
        ang_resolution (unyt_quantity): The spatial resolution of the image
            in angular coordinates. If the image is in Cartesian coordinates,
            this is None.
        cart_fov (unyt_quantity): The field of view of the image in Cartesian
            coordinates. If the image is in angular coordinates, this is None.
        ang_fov (unyt_quantity): The field of view of the image in angular
            coordinates. If the image is in Cartesian coordinates, this is
            None.
        npix (np.ndarray): The number of pixels in the image. This is a 2D
            array with the number of pixels in each dimension.
        orig_resolution (unyt_quantity): The original resolution of the image
            in the units of the image. This is used to keep track of the
            original resolution when resampling the image.
        orig_npix (np.ndarray): The original number of pixels in the image.
            This is used to keep track of the original number of pixels when
            resampling the image.
        has_cartesian_units (bool): True if the image has Cartesian units,
            False otherwise.
        has_angular_units (bool): True if the image has angular units, False
            otherwise.
        fov (unyt_quantity): The field of view of the image in the units of
            the image. This is a property that returns the field of view in
            the units of the image.
        resolution (unyt_quantity): The resolution of the image in the units
            of the image. This is a property that returns the resolution in
            the units of the image.
