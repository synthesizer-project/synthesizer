"""A submodule defining some premade instruments.

This module contains some commonly used instruments which can be imported,
instantiated, and used directly. Each premade instrument is a child of the
Instrument class with the appropriate properties fixed.

The premade instruments are:
    - JWST/NIRCam.Wide
    - JWST/NIRCam.Medium
    - JWST/NIRCam.Narrow
    - JWST/NIRCam
    - JWST/MIRI
    - HST/WFC3.UVIS.Wide
    - HST/WFC3.UVIS.Medium
    - HST/WFC3.UVIS.Narrow
    - HST/WFC3.UVI
    - HST/WFC3.IR.Wide
    - HST/WFC3.IR.Medium
    - HST/WFC3.IR.Narrow
    - HST/WFC3.IR
    - HST/ACS_WFC.Wide
    - HST/ACS_WFC.Medium
    - HST/ACS_WFC.Narrow
    - HST/ACS_WFC
    - Euclid/NISP
    - Euclid/VIS

Example usage:

    # Get NIRCam Wide instrument
    jwst_nircam = JWSTNIRCam()

    # Get MIRI with a custom wavelength array
    miri = JWSTMIRI(filter_lams=lams)

    # Get HST WFC3 UVIS with a custom depth
    wfc3_uvis = HSTWFC3UVISWide(depth=30.0, snrs=10.0)

    # Get HST WFC3 IR with a subset of filters
    wfc3_ir = HSTWFC3IRWide(filter_subset=
        [
            "HST/WFC3.IR.F110W",
            "HST/WFC3.IR.F160W",

    )

class PremadeInstrument(Instrument):
    """A base class for premade instruments.

    This class is a child of the Instrument class and is used to define
    premade instruments. It is not intended to be used directly, but
    rather as a base class for other premade instruments. Essentially,
    we include this class to reduce common methods and boilerplate code.

    By default this will just include the predefinable properties of the
    Instrument class. The user can optionally specify their own depth,
    depth aperture radius, and SNRs, or explicit noise maps to be used.
    Similarly the user can pass their own PSFs to be used.

    Alternatively, calling the load method will attempt to load the instrument
    from a file.

        ```python
        instrument = <premade instrument>.load(**kwargs)
        ```

    The upside of this is any "heavy attributes" (e.g. PSFs or
    full noise maps) will automatically be included from the file. This file
    needs to be downloaded using the download tool:

        ```bash
        synthesizer-download --instrument <instrument_name>
        ```
    Where the instrument name is the name of the class (e.g. JWSTNIRCamWide).

    This will store the downloaded instrument HDF5 file in the
    instruments_cache directory from which this class can load the instrument.
    The user is then still free to pass their own depth, depth aperture radius,
    SNRs, or explicit noise maps to be used.

    This class introduces no extra attributes or methods to the base
    Instrument class. It is simply a wrapper around the base class to
    provide a premade instrument with the properties of JWST's NIRCam
    instrument. For a list of attributes and methods see the Instrument class.
