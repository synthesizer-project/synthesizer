"""A module defining a class for observational instruments.

This module contains the `Instrument` class, which is used to define
observational instruments for use in the Synthesizer package. The
`Instrument` class contains everything needed to define a telescope or
spectrograph, including the filters, resolution, wavelength array, depth,
depth aperture radius, signal-to-noise ratios, PSFs and noise_maps.

`Instrument` objects can define instruments to be used for synthetic:
    - Photometry (with or without noise)
    - Imaging (with or without PSFs and noise)
    - Spectroscopy (with or without noise)
    - Resolved Spectroscopy (with or without PSFs and noise)

Example usage:
    # Create an Instrument object
    instrument = Instrument(
        label="HST",
        filters=FilterCollection(...),
        resolution=0.1 * kpc,
        noise_maps={...},
        psfs={...},
        )
    print(instrument)
