"""The Grid class containing tabulated spectral and line data.

This object underpins all of Synthesizer function which generates synthetic
spectra and line luminosities from models or simulation outputs. The Grid
object contains attributes and methods for interfacing with spectral and line
grids.

The grids themselves use a standardised HDF5 format which can be generated
using the synthesizer-grids sister package.

Example usage:

    from synthesizer import Grid

    # Load a grid
    grid = Grid("bc03_salpeter")

    # Get the axes of the grid
    print(grid.axes)

    # Get the spectra grid
    print(grid.spectra)

    The Grid class containing tabulated spectral and line data.

    This object contains attributes and methods for reading and
    manipulating the spectral grids which underpin all spectra/line
    generation in synthesizer.

    Attributes:
        grid_dir (str)
            The directory containing the grid HDF5 file.

            with no extension.
        grid_ext (str)
            The grid extension. Either ".hdf5" or ".h5". If the passed
            grid_name has no extension then ".hdf5" is assumed.
        grid_filename (str)
            The full path to the grid file.

        lam (Quantity, float)
            The wavelengths at which the spectra are defined.
        spectra (dict, array-like, float)
            The spectra array from the grid. This is an N-dimensional
            grid where N is the number of axes of the SPS grid. The final
            dimension is always wavelength.
        line_lams (dict, dist, float)
            A dictionary of line wavelengths.
        line_lums (dict, dict, float)
            A dictionary of line luminosities.

            A dictionary of line continuum luminosities.
        parameters (dict)

            generation.
        axes (list, str)
            A list of the names of the spectral grid axes.
        naxes
            The number of axes the spectral grid has.
        logQ10 (dict)
            A dictionary of ionisation Q parameters. (DEPRECATED)
        log10_specific_ionising_luminosity (dict)
            A dictionary of log10 specific ionising luminosities.
        <grid_axis> (array-like, float)
            A Grid will always contain 1D arrays corresponding to the axes
            of the spectral grid. These are read dynamically from the HDF5
            file so can be anything but usually contain at least stellar ages
            and stellar metallicity.
