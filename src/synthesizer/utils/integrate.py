"""A module containing integration helper functions.

This module contains functions that help with numerical integration. These
functions wrap C extensions and abstract away boilerplate code (i.e. deciding
which integration method to use, etc.).

Example:
    integrate_last_axis(xs, ys, nthreads=1, method="trapz")

    """
    Integrate the last axis of an N-dimensional array.

    Args:
        xs (array-like):
            The x-values to integrate over.
        ys (array-like):
            The y-values to integrate.
        nthreads (int):
            The number of threads to use for the integration. If -1, all
            available threads will be used.
        method (str):
            The integration method to use. Options are 'trapz' or
            'simps'.

        array-like:
