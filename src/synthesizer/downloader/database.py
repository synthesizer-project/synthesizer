"""A submodule for generating the _data_ids.yaml database of downloads.

This submodule is used for maintenance of the package and the data availeble
for download from Box, while it is included as part of the package, it is not
intended to be used by the user. It is used to generate the _data_ids.yaml
file, which will be updated in new releases as and when new data is added to
the database.

This requires the Box SDK to be installed. You can install it with
`pip install boxsdk`. You will also need to set the environment variables
`SYNTH_BOX_ID` and `SYNTH_BOX_SECRET` to the client ID and secret of your
Box application. You can create a Box application at
https://developer.box.com/console/apps (assuming you have a Box account with
edit permissions to the folder).

Once you run this script, it will prompt you to visit a URL to authorize
access to your Box account. After you authorize access, it will error, this
is a bit of a horrid hack. On the error page you will see a URL with
`code=` in it. Copy the code and paste it into the prompt. This will
generate an access token and refresh token, which will be used to
authenticate the Box client. Now the script will run and generate the
_data_ids.yaml file in the current directory.
