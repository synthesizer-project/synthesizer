"""A module for working with arrays of gas particles.

Contains the Gas class for use with particle based systems. This houses all
the data detailing collections of gas particles. Each property is
stored in (N_gas, ) shaped arrays for efficiency.

Extra optional properties can be set by providing
them as keyword arguments.

Example usages:

    """
    The base Gas class. This contains all data a collection of gas particles
    could contain. It inherits from the base Particles class holding
    attributes and methods common to all particle types.

    The Gas class can be handed to methods elsewhere to pass information
    about the gas particles needed in other computations. A galaxy object
    should have a link to the Gas object containing its gas particles,
    for example.

    Note that due to the wide range of possible properties and operations,
    this class has a large number of optional attributes which are set to
    None if not provided.

    Attributes:
        metallicities (array-like, float)
            The gas phase metallicity of each particle (integrated)
        star_forming (array-like, bool)

        smoothing_lengths (array-like, float)
