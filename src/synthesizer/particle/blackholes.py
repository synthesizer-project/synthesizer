"""A module for working with arrays of black holes.

Contains the BlackHoles class for use with particle based systems. This houses
all the data detailing collections of black hole particles. Each property is
stored in (N_bh, ) shaped arrays for efficiency.

When instantiate a BlackHoles object a myriad of extra optional properties can
be set by providing them as keyword arguments.

Example usages:

    bhs = BlackHoles(masses, metallicities,
                     redshift=redshift, accretion_rate=accretion_rate, ...)

    """
    The base BlackHoles class. This contains all data a collection of black
    holes could contain. It inherits from the base Particles class holding
    attributes and methods common to all particle types.

    The BlackHoles class can be handed to methods elsewhere to pass information
    about the stars needed in other computations. For example a Galaxy object
    can be initialised with a BlackHoles object for use with any of the Galaxy
    helper methods.

    Note that due to the many possible operations, this class has a large number
    of optional attributes which are set to None if not provided.

    Attributes:
        accretion_rate (array-like, float)
            The accretion rate of the/each black hole in Msun/yr.
        metallicities (array-like, float)
            The metallicity of the region surrounding the/each black hole.
        nbh (int)
            The number of black hole particles in the object.
        bol_luminosity (array_like, float)
            The bolometric luminosity of the/each black hole in erg/s/Hz. Only
            populated when calculate_bolometric_luminosity is called.
        bb_temperature (array_like, float)
            The "Big Bump" temperature of the/each black hole.
