class Extractor(ABC):
    """
    An abstract base class defining the framework for extraction.

    This class provides common methods and attributes for the extraction of
    emissions (sed and lines) from a grid for a given emitter. It also
    templates out what methods are needed by any child classes.

    In short, this class provides the machinery to extract emitter
    attributes corresponding to grid axes and run the extraction code to
    compute the emission from the grid. This functionality enables extraction
    from complete arbitrary grids and emitters, as long as the emitter contains
    the necessary attributes.

    Attributes:
        _emitter_attributes (tuple)
            The attributes to extract from the emitter.
        _grid_axes (tuple)
            The grid axes corresponding to the emitter attributes.
        _axes_units (tuple)
            The units for each grid axis.
        _weight_var (str)
            The weight variable to extract from the emitter and use to weight
            the emission grid. Note, this is set during grid generation and
            is stored on each grid object explictly from the grid file itself.
        _grid_dims (np.array)
            The grid dimensions, the shape of the spectra grid.
        _grid_naxes (int)
            The number of grid axes, i.e. the shape of the grid excluding the
            wavelength axis.
        _grid_nlam (int)
            The number of spectra grid wavelength elements.
        _log_emitter_attr (tuple)
            Whether to log the emitter data.
        _grid (Grid)
            The grid from which to extract the emission.
        _spectra_grid (unyt_array)
            The grid of spectra.
        _line_lum_grid (unyt_array)
            The grid of line luminosities.
        _line_cont_grid (unyt_array)
            The grid of line continua.
        _line_lams (unyt_array)
            The line wavelengths.
