# `, and `BlackHoles`.

# ### Replacing young star particles with Parametric Star Formation Histories
#
# For simulations with low mass resolution, the sampling of the star
# formation history can be affected by Poisson scatter. This is
# particularly the case for young star particles; a single massive
# particle that happens to form close to the time of observation can
# significantly alter the integrated colour of the entire galaxy.
#
# To mitigate this, we provide a method for smoothing the recent star
# formation history of a particle galaxy by replacing each young star
# particle with a parametric SFH. An example is provided [here](../sed.ipynb).
#
# This functionality can be enabled by setting the argument `parametric_
# young_stars` on any `get_spectra_*` methods. This should be set to the
# age at which you wish to smooth the SFH. The default form of the SFH is
# constant, but this can also be modified by providing a parametric SFH
# object to the `parametric_sfh` argument.

#
# We can apply a range of different dust models to our reprocessed spectra. To

# dust attenuation docs.

# get_spectra with them 1 by 1. Instead we can make/use large models
# which will generate all the spectra we want at once. For more details

# use a premade model that will produce spectra following Charlot&Fall2000

# ### Multiple galaxies
# If we want to create spectra for multiple galaxies and then interact with
# a particular spectra from them all in a single Sed object we can use a list
# comprehension. Here we grab the luminosity `lnu` of each galaxy into a
# list, and combine into a single sed object afterwards using the grid
# wavelength.

specs = Sed(lam=grid.lam, lnu=specs)

# . We instead create the 2D array of spectra, and then create an `Sed`
# object for the whole collection.

# ### Calculate broadband luminosities
#
# We can then use the `Sed` methods on the whole collection. This is much
# faster than calling the method for each spectra individually, since we
# can take advantage of vectorisation. For example, we can calculate UVJ
# colours of all the selected galaxies in just a couple of lines.
#
# First get rest frame 'flux'

# ## Collective operations
#
# It is often useful to collectively do different operations on a `Galaxy
# `. Synthesizer enables this via some wrapper methods on a galaxy which
# will operate on it's components to, for instance, get the observed
# spectra or photometry for all spectra nested in a `Galaxy`.

# Get observed spectra for all spectra
g.get_observed_spectra(cosmo=cosmo)

# Get UVJ photometry for all spectra

g.get_photo_fluxes(fc)
