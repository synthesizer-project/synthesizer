Building on the `make_sfzh` documents we can now see how to generate a
galaxy and produce its rest-frame spectral energy distribution.

# When combined with a `Grid` we can now generate the spectral energy
# distribution of a galaxy. There are a range of options available to us

# Let's star with just the pure stellar spectra. As you can see there is
# also a method on `Galaxy` objects that allows us to quickly plot spectra.

# Dust attenuation in `synthesizer` is implemented via the flexible **
# Pacman** model. This model has a few features:
#
# - In this model the parameter `fesc` denotes the fraction of light that
# entirely escapes a galaxy with no reprocessing by gas or dust.
# - Like the `get_spectra_reprocessed()` you can also set the Lyman-alpha
# escape fraction `fesc_LyA` here.
# - It is possible to calculate spectra for both a young and old
# component each with different dust attenuation.
# - Various different dust attenuation (and emission) are provided. By
# default we use a simple power-law.
# - For dust attenuation the required free parameter here is `tau_v` the
# attenuation at 5500A. If an array is provided.

# First, let's add dust attenuation using a simple screen model with a V-
# band optical depth `tau_v=0.5` and a power-law attenuation curve with `
# alpha=-1`.

# light escaping reprocessing by gas also escape dust attenuation.

# Fortunately if we want to know the true attenuation there is a method `A()`
# on Galaxy for that which take the wavelength.


# FIX COMING SOON
# galaxy.A(5500*Angstrom)


# `get_spectra_pacman()` can also implement dust attenuation separately
# for both young and old components (where the threshold is set by `young_
# old_thresh` which is log10(threshold/yr)). In this case it is also
# necessary to provide `tau_v` and `alpha` as pairs of values describing
# the ISM and birth-cloud components. Note, young stellar populations
# feel attenuation from both the ISM and birth-cloud components.

# For users more familiar with the Charlot and Fall (2000) two component

# to `0.0` and there is a more familiar way of setting the parameters.

# options include "lnu", "luminosity" or "llam" for rest frame spectra or
# "fnu", "flam" or "flux" for observed spectra.

# ### Dust emission
#
# `synthesizer` can also be used to model emission through a simple
# energy balance approach. To do this we can supply a method that
# calculates an attenuated spectrum a `synthesizer.dust.emission.
# DustEmission` object. `synthesizer` has several built-in and these are
# described in **insert referenc**.
