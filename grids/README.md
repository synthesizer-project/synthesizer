## Grids

Generate age-metallicity grids for SPS models.

### BC03

`grid_bc03.py` currently works for the original 2003 files located [here](http://www.bruzual.org/bc03/Original_version_2003/)

TODO: include methods for reading latest (2016) binary files [here](http://www.bruzual.org/bc03/Updated_version_2016/)


### FSPS

An example script for generating a grid using [FSPS](https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps) is provided, `grid_fsps.py`. This requires a working install of [python-FSPS](http://dfm.io/python-fsps/current/).
