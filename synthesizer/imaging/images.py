    The generic Image object, containing attributes and methods for calculating
    and manipulating images.

    This is the base class used for both particle and parametric images,
    containing the functionality common to both. Images can be made with or
    without a PSF and noise.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ifu_obj : obj (ParticleSpectralCube/ParametricSpectralCube)
        A local attribute holding a SpectralCube object. This is only used
        when a filter based image is requested, if an array of pixel values is
        provided this is never populated and used.
    ifu : array-like (float)
        The ifu array from _ifu_obj. This simplifies syntax for filter
        application. (npix, npix, nwavelength)
    filters : obj (FilterCollection)
        An imutable collection of Filter objects. If provided images are made
        for each filter.
    img : array-like (float)
        An array containing an image. Only used if pixel_values is defined and
        a single image is created. (npix, npix)
    imgs : dict
        A dictionary containing filter_code keys and img values. Only used if a
        FilterCollection is passed.

    Methods
    -------
    apply_filter
        Applies the transmission curve stored in Filter objects to the ifu and
        stores the resulting image in imgs.
