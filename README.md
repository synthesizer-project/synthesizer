Synthesizer is a python package for generating synthetic astrophysical spectra. It is intended to be modular, flexible and fast.

Here are just some examples of what synthesizer can do:
- generate spectra for parametric star formation and metal enrichment histories
- generate spectra for galaxies from particle-based cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
- measure spectral diagnostics for given spectra
- easily compare stellar population synthesis models
- apply screen dust models to intrinsic spectra
