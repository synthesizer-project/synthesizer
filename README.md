Synthesizer is a Python package for generating synthetic astrophysical observables. It's been built from its foundations to be modular, flexible and fast.

Read the documentation [here](https://flaresimulations.github.io/synthesizer/).

## Getting Started

In its simplest form Synthesizer's latest stable release can be installed directly using pip,

```bash
pip install cosmos-synthesizer
```

For further information on installation, please refer to the [installation documentation](https://flaresimulations.github.io/synthesizer/getting_started/installation.html).

Various configuration options can also be set when installing Synthesizer. For more details on setting these see [the configuraiton option documentation](https://flaresimulations.github.io/synthesizer/advanced/config_options.html).

## Getting Grids

To use Synthesizer you may need a grid of theoretical spectra. Premade grids can be downloaded from the [grids data server](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/3n8v3o4m85b0t8fl8pm0n/h?rlkey=9x4cijjnmvw5m6plnyovywuva&e=1&dl=0).

Note that you can also create your own grids using (or adapting) the [`grid-generation` repo](https://github.com/synthesizer-project/grid-generation) if we have not already produced the grid you want.
