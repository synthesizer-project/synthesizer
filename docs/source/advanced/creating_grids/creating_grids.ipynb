For example, to create the BC03-2016 grid you need a working fortran compiler to convert the binary files into ascii, and you can check this is available by running ``` python which gfortran ``` at the command line. Many of the scripts have the ability to download the original model data files by adding the command ```--download```, but the data for BPASS needs to be installed seperately and that data can be found on the [BPASS website](https://bpass.auckland.ac.nz/index.html). To create the FSPS grid, the python-fsps package needs to be installed and details of how to do this can be found [here](https://dfm.io/python-fsps/current/installation/). "

    "Within synthesizer_grids/cloudy/params are a variety of files that can be used to set the parameters used in Cloudy modelling, such as the ionisation parameter and hydrogen density. To use our standard approach where we allow the ionisation parameter to vary with the input ionizing source, but normalised to some reference value, the c23.01-sps.yaml is the most appropriate. Alternatively, c23.01-sps-fixed.yaml can be used for fixed ionisation parameters. To create input files with varying parameter values, we can do something like this: \n",
