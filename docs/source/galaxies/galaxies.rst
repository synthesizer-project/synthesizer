Galaxy Objects
==============

One of the basic objects in Synthesizer is the `Galaxy` object. 
A `Galaxy` contains all the information about a galaxy's components, such as its constituent stars, gas, and black holes, while providing methods for interacting with this data.
Importantly, these include methods for predicting the emission, from the galaxy as a whole and from the individual components.
