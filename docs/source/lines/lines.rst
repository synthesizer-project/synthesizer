Emission Lines
==============

In addition to creating and manipulating spectral energy distributions, synthesizer can also create ``Line`` objects, or more usefully collections of emission lines contained within ``LineCollection`` objects.
These objects provide further functionality for analysing and manipulating emission lines. 

Like spectral energy distributions, lines can be extracted directly from ``Grid`` objects or generated by ``Galaxy`` objects or their components.
In the following examples we demonstrate both.
