Emission Lines
==============

In addition to creating and manipulating spectral energy distributions, `synthesizer` can also create `Line` objects, or more usefully collections of emission lines contained within `LineCollection` objects.
These objects provide further functionality for analysing and manipulating emission lines. 

Like spectral energy distributions lines can be extracted directly from `Grid` objects or generated by `Galaxy` objects or their components.
In the following example we demonstrate this functionality.
