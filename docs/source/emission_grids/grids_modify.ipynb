    "\n",
    "While most of the models within Synthesizer are capable of handling higher dimensionality grids (i.e. grids with more dimensions than `age` and `metallicity`), other workflows might require some method to reduce the dimensionality. \n",

    "- `marginalize` over the entire axis. This is useful if you don't know anything about this parameter, and just want to adopt the average over it. You can specify the function used to marginalize with the keyword argument `marginalize_function`; the default is `np.average`. \n",
    "- Pick the value `nearest` to a specified value. If you know the value of the parameter you want to use, you can collapse the grid by picking the value closest to your specified value. For this, you need to specify the `value` keyword argument. \n",
    "- `interpolate` to a specified value. Similar to `nearest`, but with a linear interpolation to your specified `value`. This is useful in workflows where you can't adopt a discrete value, but be warned that interpolating over a coarse grid can give unrealistic results. You can apply a transformation to the axis before interpolating, e.g. to interpolate in log-space rather than linear space, with the keyword argument `pre_interp_function`. \n",
