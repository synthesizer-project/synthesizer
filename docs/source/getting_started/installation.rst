Installation
************

This guide will walk you through creating an isolated environment and installing the package.

If you instead want to set up a new installation for development see the installation instructions in the `contributing guidelines <../../CONTRIBUTING.md>'_.

Creating a python environment
#############################

First create a virtual python environment. Synthesizer has been tested with Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. You should replace this path with where you wish to install your virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv /path_to_new_virtual_environment
    source /path_to_new_virtual_environment/bin/activate

Installing from PyPI (Recommended)
##################################

To install from PyPI, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cosmos-synthesizer

This will install the latest stable version of Synthesizer and all its dependencies. 

    Note that we package Synthesizer with only a source distribution, so that the package's C extensions are compiled on your machine. This is to ensure the package is compiled with the correct flags for your system and thus the best optimisations.

Installing from source 
###################### 

To install the latest unstable version from source, clone the repository and install the package from the root directory: 

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/flaresimulations/synthesizer.git
    cd synthesizer
    pip install .

Installing with Optional Configuration Options
##############################################

Synthesizer provides several optional configuration options that can be set at installation time. These options can be set by setting environment variables prior to installation. Below we detail the most important of these options.

For a full list of configuration options and their possible values see the `configuration options docs <../advanced/config_options.rst>`_.

Installing with OpenMP support 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DISCLAIMER: This section is only important if you want to make use of shared memory parallelism for large calculations.

To make use of synthesizer's `shared memory parallelism <../parallelism/openmp.rst>`_ you must first have OpenMP installed on your system.
Most compilers come with OpenMP baked in with a few exceptions. 
This means installation with OpenMP is as simple as setting a flag at installation:

.. code-block:: bash

    WITH_OPENMP=1 pip install .

On Linux this approach should be sufficient in almost all cases. 

On OSX OpenMP must be installed via `homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ and ``setuptools`` appears to struggle automatically finding the install location.
In this situation, and any others where the automatic locating of OpenMP fails, the path to the installation can be stated explicitly:

.. code-block:: bash

    WITH_OPENMP=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/18.1.6/ pip install .

Note that the path should point to the directory containing the ``include`` and ``lib`` directories.

Optional Dependencies
##################### 

Synthesizer provides several optional dependency groups to cater to different use cases. These groups can be installed directly from PyPI using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cosmos-synthesizer[<group>] 

Or when installing from source: 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .[<group>]

The available groups are:

- **Development** (``dev``): Tools to help developing including linting and formatting.
- **Testing** (``test``): Frameworks and utilities for running tests.
- **Documentation** (``docs``): Packages required to build the project documentation.
- **Simulation-specific loaders**: Additional libraries required for loading certain simulation data:
  - ``bluetides``: For working with Bluetides simulation files. 
  - ``eagle``: For working with Eagle simulation files.

For example, to install with development dependencies, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cosmos-synthesizer[dev]

Multiple optional dependency groups can be installed in one command. For instance, to install both the testing and documentation dependencies, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cosmos-synthesizer[test,docs]
