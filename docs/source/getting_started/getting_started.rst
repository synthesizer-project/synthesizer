Welcome to Synthesizer! Below you will find all you need to get started.
This includes installation instructions, guidance on downloading grid files, a brief overview of the code structure and philosophy, a simple example and information about contributing to the project.

Once you're finished here, you can check out the more detailed documentation on the various objects and how they interact, run some of the `Examples <../auto_examples/index>`_, and explore the `API <../API.rst>`_.
