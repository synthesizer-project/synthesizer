    "The final ingredient for a fully forward modelled synthetic image is a noise field. We enable a couple interfaces to implement these on the images: \n",
    "- A simple implementation via the `noises` argument. If this argument is passed to `Galaxy.make_image` then a noise field will be created centred on 0 with this standard deviation for each filer if `noises` is a dictionary. If `noises` is a single value it will be used for all filters.\n",
    "- A more sophisticated method where the noise is calculated using an aperture, a signal to noise ratio/s (SNR/s), and depths in each filter. The arguments are defined as follows:\n",
    "    - `aperture`: Either a single value or a dicitonary with a value per filter defining the radius of the aperture in which the noise is defined. This/these values are assumed to be in the image unit system defined by the resolution.\n",
    "    - `snrs`: Either a single value or a dicitonary with a value per filter defining the signal to noise ratio inside the aperture.\n",
    "    - `depths`: Either a single value or a dicitonary with a value and unit per filter defining the depth in each filter. Must be defined in the same units as the pixel values (erg / s / Hz for rest frame luminosity, nJy for flux images). There are helper functions in `synthesizer.utils` which enable easy switching between unit systems. \n",
    "    \n",
    "As with the PSF images this can all be handled in a single call to `Galaxy.make_image`. If PSFs have been provided the noise will be applied to the images with a PSF, otherwise the PSF-less images will be used.\n",
