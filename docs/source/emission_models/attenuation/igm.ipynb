    "# Intergalactic Medium Absortion\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthesizer includes two different forms of absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM) described in the literture, ``Madau96`` and ``Inoue14``. The ``Madau96`` model is based on the work of [Madau et al. (1996)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...475..429M/abstract) and the ``Inoue14`` model is based on the work of [Inoue et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.1805I/abstract). The ``Madau96`` model is a simple model that assumes a power-law relationship between the absorption and the redshift. The ``Inoue14`` model is a more complex model that includes the effects of the Lyman-alpha forest and the Lyman limit systems.\n",

    "## Plotting the transmission curves\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover below how to use these absorption models in Synthesizer. However, if we want to visualize the transmission curves, we can instantiate the IGM class and simply call the `plot_transmission` method passing our desired redshift and wavelength array (in angstrom)."
