    "Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuates the light from distant galaxies, even after reionisation.\n",
    "Synthesizer provides two analytic forms for this IGM absorption, ``Madau96`` and ``Inoue14``.\n",
    "The ``Madau96`` model is based on [Madau et al. (1996)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...475..429M/abstract), and assumes a power-law relationship between the absorption and the redshift. \n",
    "The ``Inoue14`` model is based on [Inoue et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.1805I/abstract), and includes the effects of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest and Lyman--limit systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "To simply visualize the transmission curves, we can simply instantiate the IGM class and call the `plot_transmission` method, passing our desired redshift and wavelength array (in Angstroms)."
