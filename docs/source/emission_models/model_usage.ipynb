    "# ``EmissionModel`` functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we give an overview of the basic functionality of an ``EmissionModel``. Elsewhere we cover [what models are available](premade_models.ipynb), [how to modify a model](modify_models.ipynb), [making your own custom models](custom_models.ipynb), and [combining_models from different components](combined_models.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting a model\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an ``EmissionModel`` model we simply instatiate it with the required arguments, however, which arguments are required depends on the exact operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For extraction operations you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A grid to extract from (``grid``).\n",
    "- A key to extract (``extract``). For lines, ``line_ids`` must be passed to ``get_lines``, this key is then the label given to the ``LineCollection``. \n",
    "- Optionally, an escape fraction to apply which defaults to 0.0 (``fesc`` or ``covering_fraction`` for AGN).\n",
    "\n",
    "For combination operations you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The a list of models which will be combined (i.e. added) to give the resultant emission (``combine``).\n",
    "\n",
    "For generation you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A generator class (e.g. a [dust emission model](dust_emission.ipynb)) from which to generate spectra (``generator``). Note, this is not applicable to lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For attenuation operations you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [dust curve](attenuation/attenuation.rst) to apply (``dust_curve``).\n",
    "- The model to apply the attenuation to (``apply_dust_to``).\n",
    "- The optical depth to use with the dust curve (``tau_v``).\n",
    "\n",
    "Masking can be applied alongside any of these operations. Additionally, any number of masks can be combined on the same operation. Each mask is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The attribute of the component to mask on (``mask_attr``).\n",
    "- The threshold of the mask (``mask_thresh``).\n",
    "- The operator to use when generating the mask, i.e. ``\"<\"``, ``\">\"``, ``\"<=\"``, ``\">=\"``, ``\"==\"``, or ``\"!=\"`` (``mask_op``).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration we'll load the semi-complex ``TotalEmission`` premade stellar emisison model. When using more complex [premade models](premade_models.ipynb), with a deeper \"tree\", more parameters will be required to populate their \"child\" models deeper in the tree. This tree terminology will become clear as you read on. Don't worry about the specifics here, they are detailed in the docs linked above."
