Components
==========

``Galaxy`` objects in synthesizer consist of a number of different *components*.
These can include stellar, gas or black hole components.
Each of these components can be initialised independently of a ``Galaxy`` object, and each can be coupled with a ``Grid`` object to produce their own emission.
In the following pages we describe these components, and how to initialise them in parametric or particle form.
