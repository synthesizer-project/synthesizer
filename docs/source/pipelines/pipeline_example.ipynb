    "# The Pipeline \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a galaxy catalog (either of `Parametric` origin or from a simulation), an [`EmissionModel`](../emission_models/emission_models.rst), and a set of [instruments](../instrumentation/instrument_example.ipynb) you want observables for, you can easily write a pipeline to generate the observations you want using the Synthesizer UI. However, lets say you have a new catalog you want to run the same analysis on, or a whole different set of instruments you want to use. You could modify your old pipeline or write a whole new pipeline, but thats a lot of work and boilerplate. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the `Pipeline` shines. Instead, of having to write a pipeline, the `Pipeline` class is a high-level interface that allows you to easily generate observations for a given catalog, emission model, and set of instruments. All you need to do is define a galaxy loader, setup the ``Pipeline`` object, and run the observable methods you want to include. Possible observables include:\n",

    "- Spectra.\n",
    "- Emission Lines.\n",

    "- Images (with or without PSF convolution/noise).\n",

    "- Instrument specific spectroscopy [WIP].\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``Pipeline`` will generate all the requested observations for all (compatible) instruments and galaxies, before writing them out to a standardised HDF5 format.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus, the abstraction into the `Pipeline` class allows for easy parallelization of the analysis, not only over local threads but distributed over MPI. \n",
