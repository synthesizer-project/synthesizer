Generating spectra
==================

Synthesizer currently supports the generation of spectra for both stellar populations and AGN.
Generation of spectra for each `component <../components/components>`_ in a galaxy requires an `emission model <../emission_models/emission_models>`_ defining the different spectra to be generated.
With a model in hand, all that needs to be done is pass that model to the ``get_spectra`` method on a ``component`` or ``galaxy``. 
This will generate ``Sed`` objects (see `here <../sed/sed>`_ for an overview) and attach them to the component / galaxy.

Integrated vs Particle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Synthesizer enables the generation of both integrated spectra (a single spectra per component / galaxy) or "per--particle" spectra (a spectra for each individual particle).
The latter of these is (unsurprisingly) only applicable for particle components (`particle.Stars` and `particle.BlackHoles`), while the former can be generated for both parametric and particle components.
Additionally, galaxy level spectra are, by definition, integrated.

Integrated spectra are generated by ``get_spectra`` methods, and store the resultant spectra in a dictionary called `spectra` on the component / galaxy.
Any particle based components also provide the ``get_particle_spectra`` method, which will produce per--particle spectra, and store the generated spectra in a dictionary called ``particle_spectra`` on the component.
In the linked docs we demonstrate how, using ``EmissionModels`` in conjunction with these methods, you can generate component and galaxy spectra.
