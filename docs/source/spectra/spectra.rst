Generating spectra
==================

Synthesizer currently supports the generation of spectra for both stellar populations and AGN. 
Generation of each "`component's <../components/components>`_" spectra requires an `emission model <../emission_models/emission_models>`_ defining the different spectra to be generated.
With a model in hand all that needs to be done is pass that model to a component's (or galaxy's) ``get_spectra`` method. 
This will generate ``Sed`` objects (see `here <../sed/sed>`_ for an overview) and attach them to the component/galaxy.

Integrated vs Particle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Synthesizer enables the generation of both integrated spectra (a single spectra per component/galaxy) or "per particle" spectra (a spectra for each individual particle). 
The latter of these is (unsurisingly) only applicable for particle components (`particle.Stars` and `particle.BlackHoles`), while the former can be generated for both parametric and particle components.
Additionally, galaxy level spectra are by definition integrated. 

Integrated spectra are generated by ``get_spectra`` methods and have the resultant spectra stored in a dictionary called `spectra` on the component/galaxy.
Any particle based components also provide the ``get_particle_spectra`` method which will produce per particle spectra and store the generated spectra in a dictionary called ``particle_spectra`` on the component.
In the linked docs we demonstrate using ``EmissionModels`` in conjunction with these methods to generate component and galaxy spectra.
