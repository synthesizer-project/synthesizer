Observables
================ 

Observables are theoretical emissions that have been translated into the observer space accounting for observational effects such as pixel scales, transmission cuves, point spread functions, resolving powers, and noise.

In this section, we will cover the different types of observable that can be generated with Synthesizer, including photometry, spectroscopy, imaging, and spectral data cubes.
