    "# Emission Models\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the construction of complex spectra with many contributing components and different operations involved in their construction Synthesizer uses `EmissionModels`. These objects define the generation of a single spectra in the construction of a more complex whole. The possible operations that an `EmissionModel` can define are:\n",
    "- Extraction of a spectra from a `Grid` (see the `Grid` [docs](grids/grids_example.ipynb)).\n",
    "- Combination of different spectra.\n",
    "- Generation of dust emission spectra (see the dust emission [docs](misc/dust_emission.ipynb)).\n",
    "- Attenuation of a spectra with a dust curve (see the dust attenuation docs [WIP]()).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition any one of these operations can also be done in the presence of a mask to apply the operation to a subset of the components contents (either particles or a parametric model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an `EmissionModel` is constructed it can be passed to any `get_spectra` method on an emitter (a `Galaxy` or galaxy component) to get the spectra defined in the passed `EmissionModel` for that emitter. For more details see [generating a parametric spectra](parametric/generate_sed.ipynb) or generating a particle spectra [WIP]().\n",
    "\n",
    "## Emission model dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of operation a model can define depends on different properties being set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For extraction operations you need:\n",
    "- A grid to extract from (`grid`).\n",
    "- A spectra key to extract (`extract`).\n",
    "- Optionally, an escape fraction to apply which defaults to 0.0 (`fesc`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For combination operations you need:\n",
    "- The a list of models which will be combined into the resultant spectra (`combine`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For generation of dust emission you need:\n",
    "- A [dust emission model](misc/dust_emission.ipynb) from which to generate spectra (`dust_emission_model`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For attenuation operations you need:\n",
    "- The [dust curve]() to apply (`dust_curve`).\n",
    "- The model to apply the attenuation to (`apply_dust_to`).\n",
    "- The optical depth to use with the dust curve (`tau_v`).\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, masking can be applied alongside any of these operations. Additionally, any number of masks can be combined on the same operation. Each mask is defined by:\n",
    "- The attribute of the component to mask on (`mask_attr`).\n",
    "- The threshold of the mask (`thresh`).\n",
    "- The operator to use when generating the mask, i.e. \"<\", \">\", \"<=\", \">=\", \"==\", or \"!=\" (`op`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover all of these operations and parameters in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Premade Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections below we'll cover setting up your own model but most use cases will want a common set of spectra with a common set of properties. To avoid unnecessarily redefining common models every time Synthesizer is used we provide some premade models which can be used \"out of the box\" or as the foundation for constructing more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "These premade models can be imported directly from the `emission_models` submodule which also defines a list containing all available models we have defined."
